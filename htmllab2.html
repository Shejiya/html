    	<h3>AstraZeneca starts to make modest profit from COVID-19 vaccine</h3>
    	<h6 style="color:grey;">Published:15 Nov 2021-07:21</h6>
    	<p>AstraZeneca said it would begin to earn a modest profit from its coronavirus vaccine as the world learns to live with the virus and the drugmaker is in talks with several countries about new orders for delivery next year.</p>

        <p>AstraZeneca made a commitment to sell the shot developed with Oxford University at cost during the pandemic and in a press conference on Friday said low-income nations would continue to receive the vaccine on a no-profit basis, while a post-pandemic commercial approach would apply to other new orders even as infections in Europe rise again.</p>

        <p>The Anglo-Swedish company's third-quarter results showed the vaccine contributed one cent to core earnings per share of $1.08, a rise of 14%. Total product sales jumped 49% to $9.74 billion, as its vaccine sales topped $1 billion.</p>

        <p><q>We started this project to help ... but we also said that at some stage in the future, we will transition to commercial orders</q>Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told journalists.</p>
     
       <p><q>It will never be high priced. Because we want the vaccine to remain affordable to everybody around the world</q> he added.</p>

         <p>-<i><b>Dubai,</b></i>Australia registered a comprehensive 8 wicket win over New Zealand at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday to clinch their first T20 World Cup title. Aussies chased down the formidable target of 173 with 7 balls to spare, as Mitchell Marsh and David Warner laid the foundation of the historic win with brilliant half-centuries which took away the game from New Zealand’s reach. While Marsh remained unbeaten on 77, which included 4 sixes and 6 four, Warner smashed 3 sixes and 4 fours before getting dismissed on 53 runs. Finally, Glenn Maxwell hit a boundary at the end to seal the victory for his team.</p>

     	<h1 align="center" style="font-size:40px;"><strong>FIFA Worldcup 2022 finalists</strong></h1>

     	<p>The first qualification phase for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is nearing its conclusion with the number of nations booking their spots at the finals increasing during the international break.</p>

        <p>The tournament, scheduled to take place between Monday 21 November and Sunday 18 December, will be the last to feature 32 teams with that number being expanded to 48 for the 2026 World Cup which will be played in the United States, Mexico and Canada.</p>
 
        <p>Uefa will be the most represented confederation in Qatar with 13 spots allocated for European nations. The 10 group winners qualify automatically, with the final three places decided by a play-off round featuring the 10 runners-up and the two best-ranked group winners from the Nations League who finished third or below.</p>

        <p>There are four guaranteed places for teams from Conmebol (South America) and three for Concacaf (North America) with a team from both confederations featuring in a play-off to determine the final spot. CAF (Africa) will have five teams and there are four guaranteed places from AFC (Asia), with another inter-continental play-off to determine whether a fifth AFC team or a team from Oceania qualifies. Qatar have qualified automatically as hosts.</p>

        <p><span style="color:red;">England </span>will secure their place at the finals by avoiding a defeat against San Marino, the lowest-ranked team in world football in their final qualifier. Gareth Southgate’s squad are among the favourites to win the competition after reaching the semi-final in Russia in 2018 and coming runners-up at Euro 2020 in the summer.</p>

        <p><span style="color:red;">Scotland </span>guaranteed a play-off spot with a game to spare after beating Moldova 2-0 in their penultimate match. The Scots ended their 23-year exile from a major tournament by featuring in Euro 2020 and will be hoping to qualify for a World Cup for the first time since France ’98.</p>

        <p><span style="color:red;">Wales</span> are also assured of a play-off spot with one game remaining, even if they slip to third position in their Group. Rob Pages’ side are second in the standings and face group winners Belgium in their final game with the Czech Republic three points behind them in third. However, Wales finished top of their Nations League group ensuring they will be involved in the play-offs next March.</p>

        <p>Neither <span style="color:red;">Northern Ireland</span> or the <span style="color:red;">Republic of Ireland</span> will qualify, however, after finishing outside the top two in their respective groups.</p>
